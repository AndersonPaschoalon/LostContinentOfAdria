<h1>Lost Continent of Adria</h1>
<p><img alt="Adria" src="./img/Adria.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>In the mythical continent of Adria, a fantastic and magical land there is a permanent conflict between all the human and beast races that inhabit that land.</em></p>
<p><em>You will have the mission to lead the Nords, a human race that lives in the snowy mountains and pine forests of the north through a journey to conquer the world.</em></p>
<p><em>You will travel through deserts, forests, mountains, volcanos, and forests, full of secrets, animals, and mythical creatures.</em></p>
<h1>About this Mod</h1>
<p>I started developing this mod many years ago, playing around with the map editor and modifying the random maps scripts. 
Some (fewer) years ago I decided to create an actual Campaign with my maps, but I did not finish. This year I decided to put everything together and finish it once and for all :).</p>
<p>My idea behind the Campaign is to combine some new concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a new mechanic (more "realistic") where you can't create new unity between each quest. You will receive new units after each quest, but you cannot spawn new units on each of them. Every unity is precious, and you have to use them wisely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not a "mythological reality", but an RPG-like fantasy world, such as Dungeons and Dragons, and The Elder Scrolls. You will have a continent to explore, and many races, some humans, some not. But you are going to control armies, not a character. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Install</h2>
<p>Just place all the files in the Age of Mythology installation folder. For steam installations, the path is usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Age of Mythology".</p>
<p>To uninstall, just execute the script "LostContinentOfAdria.uninstall.bat" (take care, cannot be undone).</p>
<h2>Campaign and Gameplay</h2>
<p><img alt="Adria" src="./img/Screenshot_1.bmp" /></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main campaign, will control the <strong>Nords</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Adria" src="./img/Screenshot_4.bmp" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On each quest of the main Campaign you will have to defeat one or two armies of a rival race.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you conquer all the territory of a race, and force all their cities to surrender, this race will be included in your army, and you will be able to control its unity as well. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlike</strong> in the Vanilla game, in the Campaign quest, you <strong>CANNOT</strong> create unities. You and your enemy will start with evey unity they will have available from the start, except the one granted as gift of the gods when you advance an age. Therefore, you must use each unity wisely. Some hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the game using a <strong>deffensive strategy</strong>;</li>
<li>Protect your unitys building <strong>walls</strong> and <strong>buildings</strong>;</li>
<li>Use the <strong>terrain</strong> to gain advantage in battle. Forests, Montains and small spaces can be used as natural protecion points;</li>
<li>Create <strong>ambushes</strong> to win battles even <strong>outnumbered</strong>;</li>
<li>Protect your close-combat unitys using <strong>long-range units</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Avoid close-combat</strong> until it is strictly necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Adria" src="./img/Screenshot_3.bmp" /></p>
<p><img alt="Adria" src="./img/Screenshot_9.bmp" /></p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have to kill every single unity of your enemy to defeat its army. Instead, you will have to defeat the leader of each settlement. This unity should be close to its city setlement. The only exception for this rule is the Troll's race. You will have to defeat both the Shaman Troll and its "pet" of each settlement. The Shaman "pet" will be a powerfull mythical beast, such as a giant beatle or a dragon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lore</h2>
